# Statistics Messages

Statistics messages contain aggregated information about a vehicle over a time span or specific
action (e.g. charging the vehicle).

The statistics protobuf messages are defined in `sts/v2/vehicle/statistics.proto`.

For compatibility reasons, the statistics messages don't make use of scaling factors.
